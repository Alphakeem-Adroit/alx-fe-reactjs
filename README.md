# ALX Frontend – ReactJS

A structured collection of ReactJS projects, exercises, and concepts built as part of the **ALX Frontend Engineering Program**.

This repository demonstrates practical knowledge of modern React development including component architecture, state management, hooks, routing, reusable UI patterns, and best practices.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains hands-on implementations and learning modules focused on:

* React fundamentals
* JSX and component structure
* Props and state management
* Event handling
* React Hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
* Conditional rendering
* Lists and keys
* Forms handling
* React Router
* API integration
* Reusable component design
* Project structuring and best practices

The goal is to build scalable, maintainable, and production-ready React applications.
